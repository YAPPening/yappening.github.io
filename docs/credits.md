The development of this project would not have been possible without the help of several people. Thus we would like to thank:


- **Ms. Haber**: Who provided the foundational website idea which we could then expand on.
- **Natan Shapiro**: Providing UI design feedback and doing some preliminary testing. 
- **Will Stokes**: Our singular user for A/B Testing
- **Oliver Speir**: A maintainer on the Astro dev team, who provided useful information and help on Astro's (the javascript web framework that YAPP is coded on top of) SSR and hydration features. [Oliver's Github](https://github.com/OliverSpeir)). 
- **Baker Bruce**: A rising senior at St. Albans School, in Washington DC, who provided feedback on the various iterations of our database schema. 
- **Dependabot**: GitHub's dependency security bot (it's basically sentient right?), for doing package scans to find common vulnerabilities and exploits.
